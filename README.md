#FirstTaskHello
This project is a Python Mad Libs generator that lets the user create a funny story by choosing (or randomly picking) a template and filling in words.

How it works: The programs asks the user to either choose a template (by typing 1,2 or 3) or typing R to pick a ranodm template (random library). 
Based on the chosen template the program asks for words. When all inputs are collected the program generates a complete story using the words that the user input and print them on the screen.

To run it, you can open the file in any Python environment, run it by writing the filename and follow the instructions.
